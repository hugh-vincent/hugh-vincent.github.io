“Welcome to El Faro,<br>
What can I get for you mate? <br>
Just some cheesy chips<br>

<br>

“Yeah, just some cheesy chips”<br>

<br>


“£2.80 then please mate”<br>

<br>

I paid up and <br>
walked back down.<br>

<br>

I sat on my bedroom foor <br>
and sank them in vinegar. <br>

<br>

Man, it was good.<br>
