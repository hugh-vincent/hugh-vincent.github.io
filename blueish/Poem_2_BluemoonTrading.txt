Arthur is a<br> Zen master.<br>

<br>
I once shot him<br>
in the arm -<br>
point blank.<br>
<br>
Arthur didn’t even<br>
flinch. <br>
<br>
‘I think you just shot me’.<br>
I offered to let him <br>
shoot my foot in return.<br>
<br>

He declined and<br>
we carried on <br>
shooting tins <br>
in the sun.<br>
