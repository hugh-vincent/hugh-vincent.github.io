<b>Elderfower Pop</b><br>

<br>

Grandma Kath gave us <br>
a blue and white striped carrier bag -<br>
sometimes it was just blue.<br>

<br>

In the bag <br>
there were two to four<br>
green wine bottles. <br>

<br>

In the bottles, <br>
apart from fies,<br>
was the most delicious<br>
elderfower pop. <br>

<br>

You take a gulp <br>
straight from the bottle:<br>
it’s a sharp tang -<br>
a fy goes down too.<br>

<br>

You don’t care,<br>
not one bit. <br>

<br>

Because that elderfower pop<br>
is made entirely from love. <br>

<br>

And fies.<br>
